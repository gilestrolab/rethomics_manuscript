	abstract = {The fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, has become a critical model system for investigating sleep functions. Most studies use duration of inactivity to measure sleep. However, a defining criterion for sleep is decreased behavioral responsiveness to stimuli. Here we introduce the Drosophila {ARousal} Tracking system ({DART}), an integrated platform for efficiently tracking and probing arousal levels in animals. This video-based platform delivers positional and locomotion data, behavioral responsiveness to stimuli, sleep intensity measures, and homeostatic regulation effects – all in one combined system. We show how insight into dynamically changing arousal thresholds is crucial for any sleep study in flies. We first find that arousal probing uncovers different sleep intensity profiles among related genetic background strains previously assumed to have equivalent sleep patterns. We then show how sleep duration and sleep intensity can be uncoupled, with distinct manipulations of dopamine function producing opposite effects on sleep duration but similar sleep intensity defects. We conclude by providing a multi-dimensional assessment of combined arousal and locomotion metrics in the mutant and background strains. Our approach opens the door for deeper insights into mechanisms of sleep regulation and provides a new method for investigating the role of different genetic manipulations in controlling sleep and arousal.},

The {FLIC} (Fly Liquid-Food Interaction Counter) detects analog electronic signals as brief as 50 µs that occur when a fly makes physical contact with liquid food. Signal characteristics effectively distinguish between different types of behaviors, such as feeding and tasting events. The {FLIC} system performs as well or better than popular methods for simple assays, and it provides an unprecedented opportunity to study novel components of feeding behavior, such as time-dependent changes in food preference and individual levels of motivation and hunger. Furthermore, {FLIC} experiments can persist indefinitely without disturbance, and we highlight this ability by establishing a detailed picture of circadian feeding behaviors in the fly. We believe that the {FLIC} system will work hand-in-hand with modern molecular techniques to facilitate mechanistic studies of feeding behaviors in Drosophila using modern, high-throughput technologies.},

	abstract = {Early brain development can be influenced by numerous genetic and environmental factors, with long-lasting effects on brain function and behavior. The identification of these factors is facilitated by recent innovations in high-throughput screening. However, large-scale screening in whole organisms remains challenging, in particular when studying changes in brain function or behavior in vertebrate model systems. In this study, we present a novel imaging system for high-throughput analyses of behavior in zebrafish larvae. The three-camera system can image 12 multiwell plates simultaneously and is unique in its ability to provide local visual stimuli in the wells of a multiwell plate. The acquired images are converted into a series of coordinates, which characterize the location and orientation of the larvae. The developed imaging techniques were tested by measuring avoidance behaviors in seven-day-old zebrafish larvae. The system effectively quantified larval avoidance and revealed an increased edge preference in response to a blue or red ‘bouncing ball’ stimulus. Larvae also avoid a bouncing ball stimulus when it is counter-balanced with a stationary ball, but do not avoid blinking balls counter-balanced with a stationary ball. These results indicate that the seven-day-old larvae respond specifically to movement, rather than color, size, or local changes in light intensity. The imaging system and assays for measuring avoidance behavior may be used to screen for genetic and environmental factors that cause developmental brain disorders and for novel drugs that could prevent or treat these disorders.},

Here we review several genetic analyses that broadly extend that viewpoint. They support a model whereby the approximately 150 circadian clock cells in the brain of the fly are sub-divided into functionally discrete rhythmic centers. These centers alternatively cooperate or compete to control the different episodes of rhythmic behavior that define the fly's daily activity profile.},

The Lomb-Scargle method was tested on both real and simulated time-series with even and uneven sampling, and compared to a standard method in biomedical rhythm research, the Chi-square periodogram. Results indicate that the Lomb–Scargle algorithm shows a clearly better detection efficiency and accuracy in the presence of noise, and avoids possible bias or erroneous results that may arise from replacement of missing data by interpolation techniques. Hence, the Lomb–Scargle periodogram may serve as a useful method for the study of biological rhythms, especially when applied to telemetrical or observational time-series obtained from free-living animals, i.e., data sets that notoriously lack points.},

	abstract = {We have characterized a light-input pathway regulating Drosophila clock neuron excitability. The molecular clock drives rhythmic electrical excitability of clock neurons, and we show that the recently discovered light-input factor Quasimodo (Qsm) regulates this variation, presumably via an Na+, K+, Cl− cotransporter ({NKCC}) and the Shaw K+ channel ({dKV}3.1). Because of light-dependent degradation of the clock protein Timeless (Tim), constant illumination ({LL}) leads to a breakdown of molecular and behavioral rhythms. Both overexpression ({OX}) and knockdown ({RNAi}) of qsm, {NKCC}, or Shaw led to robust {LL} rhythmicity. Whole-cell recordings of the large ventral lateral neurons (l-{LNv}) showed that altering Qsm levels reduced the daily variation in neuronal activity: {qsmOX} led to a constitutive less active, night-like state, and {qsmRNAi} led to a more active, day-like state. Qsm also affected daily changes in K+ currents and the {GABA} reversal potential, suggesting a role in modifying membrane currents and {GABA} responses in a daily fashion, potentially modulating light arousal and input to the clock. When directly challenged with blue light, wild-type l-{LNvs} responded with increased firing at night and no net response during the day, whereas altering Qsm, {NKKC}, or Shaw levels abolished these day/night differences. Finally, coexpression of {ShawOX} and {NKCCRNAi} in a qsm mutant background restored {LL}-induced behavioral arrhythmicity and wild-type neuronal activity patterns, suggesting that the three genes operate in the same pathway. We propose that Qsm affects both daily and acute light effects in l-{LNvs} probably acting on Shaw and {NKCC}.},

Using this method, we were able to measure the volume ingested in single sips of an individual, and monitor the absorption of food with high temporal resolution. We demonstrate that flies ingest food by rhythmically extending their proboscis with a frequency that is not modulated by the internal state of the animal. Instead, hunger and satiety homeostatically modulate the microstructure of feeding. These results highlight similarities of food intake regulation between insects, rodents, and humans, pointing to a common strategy in how the nervous systems of different animals control food intake.},

	abstract = {Behaviour is the ultimate output of an animal's nervous system and choosing the right action at the right time can be critical for survival. A quantitative understanding of behaviour would therefore advance research in neuroscience as well as ecology and evolution. However, animal posture typically has many degrees of freedom and behavioural dynamics vary on timescales ranging from milliseconds to years, presenting both technical and conceptual challenges. Here we review 1) advances in imaging and computer vision that are making it possible to capture increasingly complete records of animal motion and 2) new approaches to understanding the resulting behavioural data sets. With the right analytical approaches, these data are allowing researchers to revisit longstanding questions about the structure and organisation of animal behaviour and to put unifying principles on a quantitative footing. Contributions from both experimentalists and theorists are leading to the emergence of a physics of behaviour and the prospect of discovering laws and developing theories with broad applicability. We believe that there now exists an opportunity to develop theories of behaviour which can be tested using these data sets leading to a deeper understanding of how and why animals behave.},
