This is especially the case for feeding behaviour in small, genetically tractable animals such as Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we present a method based on capacitive measurements, which allows the detailed, automated and high-throughput quantification of feeding behaviour. Using this method, we were able to measure the volume ingested in single sips of an individual, and monitor the absorption of food with high temporal resolution. We demonstrate that flies ingest food by rhythmically extending their proboscis with a frequency that is not modulated by the internal state of the animal. Instead, hunger and satiety homeostatically modulate the microstructure of feeding. These results highlight similarities of food intake regulation between insects, rodents, and humans, pointing to a common strategy in how the nervous systems of different animals control food intake.},

	abstract = {We have characterized a light-input pathway regulating Drosophila clock neuron excitability. The molecular clock drives rhythmic electrical excitability of clock neurons, and we show that the recently discovered light-input factor Quasimodo (Qsm) regulates this variation, presumably via an Na+, K+, Cl− cotransporter ({NKCC}) and the Shaw K+ channel ({dKV}3.1). Because of light-dependent degradation of the clock protein Timeless (Tim), constant illumination ({LL}) leads to a breakdown of molecular and behavioral rhythms. Both overexpression ({OX}) and knockdown ({RNAi}) of qsm, {NKCC}, or Shaw led to robust {LL} rhythmicity. Whole-cell recordings of the large ventral lateral neurons (l-{LNv}) showed that altering Qsm levels reduced the daily variation in neuronal activity: {qsmOX} led to a constitutive less active, night-like state, and {qsmRNAi} led to a more active, day-like state. Qsm also affected daily changes in K+ currents and the {GABA} reversal potential, suggesting a role in modifying membrane currents and {GABA} responses in a daily fashion, potentially modulating light arousal and input to the clock. When directly challenged with blue light, wild-type l-{LNvs} responded with increased firing at night and no net response during the day, whereas altering Qsm, {NKKC}, or Shaw levels abolished these day/night differences. Finally, coexpression of {ShawOX} and {NKCCRNAi} in a qsm mutant background restored {LL}-induced behavioral arrhythmicity and wild-type neuronal activity patterns, suggesting that the three genes operate in the same pathway. We propose that Qsm affects both daily and acute light effects in l-{LNvs} probably acting on Shaw and {NKCC}.},

The Lomb-Scargle method was tested on both real and simulated time-series with even and uneven sampling, and compared to a standard method in biomedical rhythm research, the Chi-square periodogram. Results indicate that the Lomb–Scargle algorithm shows a clearly better detection efficiency and accuracy in the presence of noise, and avoids possible bias or erroneous results that may arise from replacement of missing data by interpolation techniques. Hence, the Lomb–Scargle periodogram may serve as a useful method for the study of biological rhythms, especially when applied to telemetrical or observational time-series obtained from free-living animals, i.e., data sets that notoriously lack points.},

Here we review several genetic analyses that broadly extend that viewpoint. They support a model whereby the approximately 150 circadian clock cells in the brain of the fly are sub-divided into functionally discrete rhythmic centers. These centers alternatively cooperate or compete to control the different episodes of rhythmic behavior that define the fly's daily activity profile.},

The identification of these factors is facilitated by recent innovations in high-throughput screening. However, large-scale screening in whole organisms remains challenging, in particular when studying changes in brain function or behavior in vertebrate model systems. In this study, we present a novel imaging system for high-throughput analyses of behavior in zebrafish larvae. The three-camera system can image 12 multiwell plates simultaneously and is unique in its ability to provide local visual stimuli in the wells of a multiwell plate. The acquired images are converted into a series of coordinates, which characterize the location and orientation of the larvae. The developed imaging techniques were tested by measuring avoidance behaviors in seven-day-old zebrafish larvae. The system effectively quantified larval avoidance and revealed an increased edge preference in response to a blue or red ‘bouncing ball’ stimulus. Larvae also avoid a bouncing ball stimulus when it is counter-balanced with a stationary ball, but do not avoid blinking balls counter-balanced with a stationary ball. These results indicate that the seven-day-old larvae respond specifically to movement, rather than color, size, or local changes in light intensity. The imaging system and assays for measuring avoidance behavior may be used to screen for genetic and environmental factors that cause developmental brain disorders and for novel drugs that could prevent or treat these disorders.},

	abstract = {The fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, has become a critical model system for investigating sleep functions. Most studies use duration of inactivity to measure sleep. However, a defining criterion for sleep is decreased behavioral responsiveness to stimuli. Here we introduce the Drosophila {ARousal} Tracking system ({DART}), an integrated platform for efficiently tracking and probing arousal levels in animals. This video-based platform delivers positional and locomotion data, behavioral responsiveness to stimuli, sleep intensity measures, and homeostatic regulation effects – all in one combined system. We show how insight into dynamically changing arousal thresholds is crucial for any sleep study in flies. We first find that arousal probing uncovers different sleep intensity profiles among related genetic background strains previously assumed to have equivalent sleep patterns. We then show how sleep duration and sleep intensity can be uncoupled, with distinct manipulations of dopamine function producing opposite effects on sleep duration but similar sleep intensity defects. We conclude by providing a multi-dimensional assessment of combined arousal and locomotion metrics in the mutant and background strains. Our approach opens the door for deeper insights into mechanisms of sleep regulation and provides a new method for investigating the role of different genetic manipulations in controlling sleep and arousal.},

	abstract = {Behaviour is the ultimate output of an animal's nervous system and choosing the right action at the right time can be critical for survival. A quantitative understanding of behaviour would therefore advance research in neuroscience as well as ecology and evolution. However, animal posture typically has many degrees of freedom and behavioural dynamics vary on timescales ranging from milliseconds to years, presenting both technical and conceptual challenges. Here we review 1) advances in imaging and computer vision that are making it possible to capture increasingly complete records of animal motion and 2) new approaches to understanding the resulting behavioural data sets. With the right analytical approaches, these data are allowing researchers to revisit longstanding questions about the structure and organisation of animal behaviour and to put unifying principles on a quantitative footing. Contributions from both experimentalists and theorists are leading to the emergence of a physics of behaviour and the prospect of discovering laws and developing theories with broad applicability. We believe that there now exists an opportunity to develop theories of behaviour which can be tested using these data sets leading to a deeper understanding of how and why animals behave.},

Eliminating this disparity will require concerted policy action by funding agencies and journal publishers, as well as changes in the way research institutions receiving public funds manage their intellectual property ({IP}).

This article extends the literature by studying journal data sharing policies by year (for both 2011 and 2012) for a referent set of 170 journals. We make a further contribution by evaluating code sharing policies, supplemental materials policies, and open access status for these 170 journals for each of 2011 and 2012. We build a predictive model of open data and code policy adoption as a function of impact factor and publisher and find higher impact journals more likely to have open data and code policies and scientific societies more likely to have open data and code policies than commercial publishers. We also find open data policies tend to lead open code policies, and we find no relationship between open data and code policies and either supplemental material policies or open access journal status. Of the journals in this study, 38\% had a data policy, 22\% had a code policy, and 66\% had a supplemental materials policy as of June 2012. This reflects a striking one year increase of 16\% in the number of data policies, a 30\% increase in code policies, and a 7\% increase in the number of supplemental materials policies. We introduce a new dataset to the community that categorizes data and code sharing, supplemental materials, and open access policies in 2011 and 2012 for these 170 journals.},

The versatility and attractiveness of the wavelet approach lie in its decomposition properties, principally its time-scale localization. It is especially relevant to the analysis of non-stationary systems, i.e., systems with short-lived transient components, like those observed in ecological systems. Here, we review the basic properties of the wavelet approach for time-series analysis from an ecological perspective. Wavelet decomposition offers several advantages that are discussed in this paper and illustrated by appropriate synthetic and ecological examples. Wavelet analysis is notably free from the assumption of stationarity that makes most methods unsuitable for many ecological time series. Wavelet analysis also permits analysis of the relationships between two signals, and it is especially appropriate for following gradual change in forcing by exogenous variables.},

Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Finland do not show statistically relevant degrees of synchronization with Europe. We also show that some countries (like Spain) have a French accent, while others have a German accent (e.g., Austria). Perhaps surprisingly, we find that the French business cycle has been leading the German business cycle as well as the rest of Europe. Among the countries that may, in the future, join the Euro, the Czech Republic seems the most promising candidate.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the application of the wavelet transform ({WT}) to climate time series analyses is introduced. A tutorial description of the basic concept of {WT}, compared with similar concepts used in music, is also provided. Using an analogy between {WT} representation of a time series and a music score, the authors illustrate the importance of local versus global information in the time–frequency localization of climate signals. Examples of {WT} applied to climate data analysis are demonstrated using analytic signals as well as real climate time series. Results of {WT} applied to two climate time series—that is, a proxy paleoclimate time series with a 2.5-Myr deep-sea sediment record of δ18 O and a 140-yr monthly record of Northern Hemisphere surface temperature—are presented. The former shows the presence of a 40-kyr and a 100-kyr oscillation and an abrupt transition in the oscillation regime at 0.7 Myr before the present, consistent with previous studies. The latter possesses a myriad of oscillatory modes from interannual (2–5 yr), interdecadal (10–12 yr, 20–25 yr, and 40–60 yr), and century ({\textasciitilde}180 yr) scales at different periods of the data record. In spite of the large difference in timescales, common features in time–frequency characteristics of these two time series have been identified. These features suggest that the variations of the earth's climate are consistent with those exhibited by a nonlinear dynamical system under external forcings.},

	abstract = {An arbitrary square integrable real-valued function (or, equivalently, the associated Hardy function) can be conveniently analyzed into a suitable family of square integrable wavelets of constant shape, (i.e. obtained by shifts and dilations from any one of them.) The resulting integral transform is isometric and self-reciprocal if the wavelets satisfy an “admissibility condition” given here. Explicit expressions are obtained in the case of a particular analyzing family that plays a role analogous to that of coherent states (Gabor wavelets) in the usual \$L\_2 \$ -theory. They are written in terms of a modified \${\textbackslash}Gamma \$-function that is introduced and studied. From the point of view of group theory, this paper is concerned with square integrable coefficients of an irreducible representation of the nonunimodular \$ax + b\$-group.},
