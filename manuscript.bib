With ggplot2, it's easy to: produce handsome, publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from the plot specificationsuperimpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with automatically adjusted common scalesadd customizable smoothers that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalized additive models, and robust regressionsave any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reusecreate custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to multiple plotsapproach a graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page.},

This is especially the case for feeding behaviour in small, genetically tractable animals such as Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we present a method based on capacitive measurements, which allows the detailed, automated and high-throughput quantification of feeding behaviour. Using this method, we were able to measure the volume ingested in single sips of an individual, and monitor the absorption of food with high temporal resolution. We demonstrate that flies ingest food by rhythmically extending their proboscis with a frequency that is not modulated by the internal state of the animal. Instead, hunger and satiety homeostatically modulate the microstructure of feeding. These results highlight similarities of food intake regulation between insects, rodents, and humans, pointing to a common strategy in how the nervous systems of different animals control food intake.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1606547113},
	abstract = {We have characterized a light-input pathway regulating Drosophila clock neuron excitability. The molecular clock drives rhythmic electrical excitability of clock neurons, and we show that the recently discovered light-input factor Quasimodo (Qsm) regulates this variation, presumably via an Na+, K+, Cl− cotransporter ({NKCC}) and the Shaw K+ channel ({dKV}3.1). Because of light-dependent degradation of the clock protein Timeless (Tim), constant illumination ({LL}) leads to a breakdown of molecular and behavioral rhythms. Both overexpression ({OX}) and knockdown ({RNAi}) of qsm, {NKCC}, or Shaw led to robust {LL} rhythmicity. Whole-cell recordings of the large ventral lateral neurons (l-{LNv}) showed that altering Qsm levels reduced the daily variation in neuronal activity: {qsmOX} led to a constitutive less active, night-like state, and {qsmRNAi} led to a more active, day-like state. Qsm also affected daily changes in K+ currents and the {GABA} reversal potential, suggesting a role in modifying membrane currents and {GABA} responses in a daily fashion, potentially modulating light arousal and input to the clock. When directly challenged with blue light, wild-type l-{LNvs} responded with increased firing at night and no net response during the day, whereas altering Qsm, {NKKC}, or Shaw levels abolished these day/night differences. Finally, coexpression of {ShawOX} and {NKCCRNAi} in a qsm mutant background restored {LL}-induced behavioral arrhythmicity and wild-type neuronal activity patterns, suggesting that the three genes operate in the same pathway. We propose that Qsm affects both daily and acute light effects in l-{LNvs} probably acting on Shaw and {NKCC}.},

This method is particularly suited to detect periodic components in unequally sampled time-series and data sets with missing values, but restricts all calculations to actually measured values. The Lomb-Scargle method was tested on both real and simulated time-series with even and uneven sampling, and compared to a standard method in biomedical rhythm research, the Chi-square periodogram. Results indicate that the Lomb–Scargle algorithm shows a clearly better detection efficiency and accuracy in the presence of noise, and avoids possible bias or erroneous results that may arise from replacement of missing data by interpolation techniques. Hence, the Lomb–Scargle periodogram may serve as a useful method for the study of biological rhythms, especially when applied to telemetrical or observational time-series obtained from free-living animals, i.e., data sets that notoriously lack points.},

In addition, we describe the effects of serial correlation and examine the resolving power of the method for two periodic components in the circadian range. We suggest how the method can be most profitably employed in the analysis of event-recorder data for detection of rhythmicity in the range 14 to 34 h., and for the estimation of period to ±0·2 h.},
